A web application to efficiently manage your Spotify liked songs across multiple playlists. The app provides a simple interface to view and organize your liked songs, making it easier to add or remove tracks from your playlists.

## Features
- View all your liked songs in one place
- See which songs are in which playlists at a glance
- Easily add/remove songs to/from multiple playlists
- Control song playback directly from the interface
- Dark/Light mode
- Already played songs are marked
- Keyboard navigation for power users

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 (other versions might work but are untested)
- Spotify Premium account 

## Spotify Setup

1. Go to [Spotify Developer Portal](https://developer.spotify.com) and make yourself a developer
2. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) 
3. Create a new application
4. Set the redirect URI to `http://localhost:8888/callback`
5. Copy your Client ID and Client Secret 
6. In the App settings, activate Web API and Web Playback SDK

## Python Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexanderalber/spotify-playlist-manager
cd spotify-playlist-manager
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Enter your Spotify credentials:
   - Create a file named `envvars.py`
   - Add your Spotify API credentials:
   ```python
   client_id = "your_client_id_here"
   client_secret = "your_client_secret_here"
   ```
   - Keep this file secure and never commit it to version control

5. Initialize the database (your browser might open and Spotify might ask for permission):
```bash
python read_from_spotify.py
```

## Usage

1. Make sure that Spotify is open and running somewhere. This app does not actually play music by itself, it will instead trigger playback on the actual Spotify app. 

2. Run the application (your browser might open and Spotify might ask for permission):
```bash
python app.py
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8888`

### Controls
- **Mouse Controls:**
  - Click cells to toggle playlist membership
  - Click play button to start/stop playback
  - Click anywhere in a row to select it for keyboard controls
  - Click the sun/moon icon to toggle dark/light theme
  - Click refresh to update data from Spotify

- **Keyboard Controls:**
  - ↑/↓: Navigate through songs
  - Space: Play/stop selected song
  - 1-9: Quick-toggle playlists
  - Esc: Stop playback
  - ←/→: Skip 20s backward/forward

### Behavior Notes
- Playlist memberships (cells) are updated on Spotify instantly - no refresh necessary
- Songs already played in this app are marked with color
- Dark/light theme persists across sessions
- Refresh button updates:
  - Removes unliked songs
  - Adds new liked songs
  - Updates playlist structure
  - Can take 10-20 seconds for large libraries

```

## Development

The application uses a modular JavaScript architecture:
- `utils.js`: Common utility functions and API calls
- `ui-manager.js`: Handles UI state and theme
- `playlist-manager.js`: Manages playlist operations
- `playback-manager.js`: Controls music playback
- `navigation-manager.js`: Handles row selection and navigation
- `keyboard-manager.js`: Manages keyboard shortcuts

The Flask backend provides:
- Authentication with Spotify
- Database management
- API endpoints for all operations
- Static file serving

## Troubleshooting
